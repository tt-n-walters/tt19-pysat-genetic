# Hand-written Genetic Algorithm
# Implement a binary genetic algorithm with:

#     fitness proportional selection
#     1-point crossover
#     bit-flip mutation

# Fitness is the number of 1s in the chromosome.
# The optimal solution is the chromosome where all the genes are set to 1.
# Simulate for various populations and chromosome lengths.
